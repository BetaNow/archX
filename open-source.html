            <a href="https://github.com/amark/gun" target="_blank">OpenSSL</a>
            GUN is a peer2peer protocol that share data between several machines in live. With encryption, serializaion of the data and more you can easily build an application based on this protocol like alternative to Youtube, Zoom or Facebook.     
            The protocol is implemented in JS and you can integrate it easily in your HTML with CDNs headers or directly in your JS code.

            A promising high-level, massively parallel programming language. Bend have the particularity to parallelize automatically every single mathematical operation allowing you to exploit 100% of your GPU without having to handle thread creation, locks, mutexes, or atomics.
            Bend is cross-platform, available on WSL2 and can support 10000 concurrent thread. Only Nvidia's GPU are supported for the moment.
