				<tr> <td>SERIOUS CRYPTOGRAPHY a Practical: Introduction to Modern Encryption  </td ><td>Jean-Philippe Aumasson </td> <td>2018</td> <td>Interesting book for beginner in cryptography. Talk about classic, modern and quantum cryptography with example of application in python or golang. Every thing is pretty easy to understand and it give you a really good overview of cryptography. </td>

				<tr> <td>Mathematics of Public Key Cryptography </td ><td> Steven Galbraith </td> <td>2012</td> <td> This book gives a rigorous presentation of most of the mathematics underlying public
					key cryptography. Our main focus is mathematics. We put mathematical precision and
					rigour ahead of generality, practical issues in real-world cryptography, or algorithmic
					optimality. </td>

					Digital signatures are used to detect unauthorized modifications to data and to authenticate the
					identity of the signatory. This standard also specifies DSA (digital signature algorithm) which is used to implemente public key cryptography more securelly such as RSA, DH or EC.</td>	<td><a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/fips/nist.fips.186-4.pdf" target="_blank">LINK</a></td> </tr>

Both key- agreement and key transport schemes are specified for pairs of entities, and methods for key confirmation are included to provide assurance that both parties share the same keying material. In addition, the security properties associated with each scheme are provided.</td>	<td> <a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-56Br2.pdf" target="blank">	LINK</a></td> </tr>
